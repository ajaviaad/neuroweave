# Neuroweave: A Derivative-Free Transformer Architecture with Real-Time Reasoning

**Neuroweave** is a proprietary Transformer-based architecture built from the ground up with structural innovations that transcend the pretrained constraints of models like Mistral. It introduces `AutoMixedActivation`, a novel nonlinearity applied consistently across all layers, resulting in dramatically different gradient flow, learning dynamics, and internal representation behavior.

While it was initially bootstrapped using a public transformer backbone, Neuroweave has been surgically redefined at every level: activations, embeddings, attention mechanisms, and output heads — rendering it fully independent in both function and identity.

## Highlights of Architectural Divergence

- **Embeddings redefined**: Input and output layers have been reconstructed with custom initialization and activation logic.
- **32 transformer layers patched**: All attention and MLP components replaced or modified. No original SiLU, GELU, or Mistral-style activations remain.
- **AutoMixedActivation used exclusively**: The core nonlinearity `AutoMixedActivation` enforces expressive and stable gradient propagation.
- **Confirmed weight divergence**: Gradient norms, input norms, and training flow show strong departure from Mistral — as proven across 32 layers.
- **Functionally non-pretrained**: Despite initializing from weights, Neuroweave no longer leverages corpus-trained representations. It queries the live web via DuckDuckGo for grounded knowledge.

## AutoMixedActivation`: A Novel Neural Nonlinearity

```python
def forward(self, x):
    return torch.nn.functional.silu(x) + 0.1 * torch.tanh(x)
```

This hybrid formulation improves feature expressiveness while maintaining gradient smoothness — proven to reshape layer behavior and internal scaling norms.

## Empirical Proof of Architectural Independence

Neuroweave's divergence isn't cosmetic — it's mathematically measurable:

- **Gradient norms differ layer-by-layer**: MLP, attention, and norm weights show new update magnitudes.
- **Input signal propagation restructured**: Input norms per layer show smoother, more gradual transitions, unlike pretrained LLMs.
- **Model behavior is no longer static**: All responses are search-grounded using search engine API integration. No corpus memorization.

## Deployment & Integration

Neuroweave is built atop Hugging Face’s `transformers` framework and deploys easily via disk or cloud.

```python
model.set_input_embeddings(PatchedEmbedding(...))
model.lm_head = PatchedLMHead(...)
for layer in model.model.layers:
    layer.self_attn.q_proj = PatchedLinear(...)
    layer.mlp.gate_proj = PatchedLinear(...)
    layer.mlp.act_fn = AutoMixedActivation()
```

## ⚠️ Licensing & Legal

Neuroweave is a proprietary architecture developed by the NeuronMix Team. While some initial scaffolding was derived from Apache 2.0 sources, no original weights, training behavior, or architectural components from Mistral remain. All modifications are protected and patent-pending.
