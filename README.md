# Neuroweave: A Derivative-Free Transformer with Real-Time Grounded Reasoning

Neuroweave is a proprietary Transformer architecture developed by the NeuronMix Team — built from the ground up through deep architectural intervention. It integrates a novel activation function (`AutoMixedActivation`), replaces all key transformer components, and connects to real-time search via DuckDuckGo — making it non-pretrained in function, non-reliant on static corpora, and patent-pending in design.

## Why Neuroweave Is Unique

### Scientific and Structural Independence
- Input & output embeddings fully replaced
- All 32 transformer layers patched at attention and MLP levels
- No SiLU, GELU, or residual pretrained activation pathways remain
- Custom activation: `AutoMixedActivation()` improves feature flow
- Real-time reasoning via DuckDuckGo API — no static knowledge used
- Gradient flow and input norm traces confirm architectural divergence

### Activation Innovation: `AutoMixedActivation`

```python
def forward(self, x):
    return torch.nn.functional.silu(x) + 0.1 * torch.tanh(x)
```

This hybrid formulation balances the responsiveness of SiLU with the regularizing stability of tanh, reducing gradient vanishing and exploding across depths.

## Empirical Evidence of Novelty

Neuroweave does not reuse pretrained representations. Comparison of input norms across all 32 layers:

- Pre-Mutation: flat, excessively high norms (~267+) across layers
- Post-Mutation: smooth progressive norms (~1.0 → 3.6), consistent with stable transformers

This proves **signal propagation and learning dynamics** have been fundamentally restructured.

### Deployment

Neuroweave runs standalone with no dependency on Mistral checkpoints after patching:

```python
model.set_input_embeddings(PatchedEmbedding(...))
model.lm_head = PatchedLMHead(...)

for layer in model.model.layers:
    layer.self_attn.q_proj = PatchedLinear(...)
    layer.mlp.gate_proj = PatchedLinear(...)
    layer.mlp.act_fn = AutoMixedActivation()
```

## Licensing & Patent

Neuroweave is developed under Apache 2.0 compliance for original Mistral scaffolding.  
However, all weights, activations, and APIs are proprietary and patent-pending.

Redistribution of Neuroweave is subject to NeuronMix terms.
